      "order accurate. delivery punctual. however, specialty chicken saltier than would've prefered.\n",
      "i normally order pretty often but this experience is leaving a bad taste in my mouth and my order hasn't even arrived yet even though the tracking says it has. i called to question where my delivery was at and the girl just tried to rush me off the phone.\n",

      "usually orders are good.. but today the chicken on the pizza was not completely cooked. there was about 10 pieces total  which is very little compared to to how much we usually get and they were all not fully cooked.\n",
      "one was only 12 full extra chick was very little chicken on both orders\n",
      "pizza was really good. kind of disappointed in the salad. some of lettuce was bad and hardly any purple cabbage. definitely not worth the 6.99 i paid for it.\n"
